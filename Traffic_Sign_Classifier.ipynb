    "(1) Use the original LeNet, and evaluation accuracy is 94.5% and testing data accuracy is 87%.\n",

    "(2) Modify the LeNet so that it takes the grayscale images and convert the training images from rgb to grayscale. As a result, the evaluation accuracy is 95% and testing data accuracy is 88%. So there is no drop by using less image channel, however in this way, we could reduce the parameters by 2/3.\n",

    "(3) Without any other changes, just replace the LeNet with ConvNet from this  [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf), but the accuracy is about the same. However, I noticed that If I use much deeper networks, the deeper network is able to learn the model much better (93% for the testing data) than shadow model (LeNet 88% for testing data). Of course, it takes much more computational power and it is much slower. But I would like to stick to the simple architecture, and see how to improve the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) After generate 5 time extra training datas, without any other changes, the performance increase to 94% for the testing data with LeNet. So my conclusion is that for shadow network, the insufficient training dataset can be a problem to keep your performance low. Therefore, it will be beneficial to generate extra training dataset.\n",
